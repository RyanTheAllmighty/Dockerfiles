# Dockerfiles
This is a repository for all my Dockerfiles used to build my own Docker images

You can find specific details for each of the Docker files in each of the directories of this repository.

# Docker Hub
My images are available on Docker Hub as automated builds [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/ryantheallmighty/).

# Warnings and General Notices
These images are based mostly off their Docker Hub official image Dockerfiles with some tweaks here and there to suit my own setup.

While I do use these images, I don't recommend using them for anything production worthy simply due to the fact that the official images will probably work better for that.
